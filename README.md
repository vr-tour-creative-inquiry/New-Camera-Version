Jake's note:
Currently the scenes each have a radius of 20 and are 50m apart.
If you change the position of a scene, you must change the data-newX/Y/Z
attributes for any links to that scene as well. I'm trying to find a
better way for the function to get the new coordinates, but until then
we'll use those attributes. We will also need a template for the arrows/spheres like
Nate had set up in the other file to reduce code.
